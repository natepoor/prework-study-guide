# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
A study guide webpage I created through the prework steps.
I built this project to gain a better understanding of coding.
This site may help with an introduction to coding.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
You can view the notes in each section.
For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
